# AGENTS.md — personal-portfolio

## Overview
Personal portfolio website showcasing AI engineering and software development work. Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4 + TypeScript. Targeting Senior Software Developer / AI Engineer roles.

## Commands
- Install: `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Test all: `npm test`
- Test single: `npx vitest run tests/<path>`
- Dev: `npm run dev`

## Workflow (SDD — Spec-Driven Development)

Features are built through a 3-phase lifecycle. **Do not skip phases.**

### Phase 1: Design (interactive — user makes decisions)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/grill <topic>` | Design interview — exhaustive Q&A exploring design space |
| `/ba-validate <spec>` | Validate spec quality (structural + semantic) |
| `/approve <spec>` | Approve spec for implementation |
| `/researcher <question>` | Deep investigation with parallel explorers (ARIA v2) |

### Phase 2: Implement (automatic — walk away)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sdd <feature>` | Full pipeline: plan → test → code → review → retro |
| `/trio <feature>` | Sprint-only: wave dispatch with worktree isolation |

### Phase 3: Review (human — evaluate results)
- Play with the feature, file issues if changes needed
- Run `/sdd` again for fixes, `/grill` for design changes

### Everyday Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/orient [area]` | Map codebase structure, tech stack, commands, architecture |
| `/quick-review <target>` | Lightweight review — files, diffs, or PRs. Escalate to `/adversarial-review` for complex changes |
| `/debug <error>` | Dispatch a debugger subagent to investigate a bug |

### Workflow Commands (Dynamic)
These use Claude Code's dynamic workflows for automated parallel orchestration:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ultracode: <task>` | Trigger a workflow for a specific task |
| `/adversarial-review` | Multi-angle code review with adversarial verify |
| `/deep-audit` | Comprehensive codebase audit |
| `/research-crosscheck` | Multi-angle research with cross-checked sources |
| `/migration-sweep` | Codebase-wide migration pipeline |

## Agent Roles

### Main Session (interactive, persistent)
| Role | Mode | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Supervisor/Planner | Default | Orchestrate, diagnose, delegate. Never implements. |
| Sprint-Manager | `/trio` skill | Wave dispatch, gate ownership, worktree merge |
| Researcher | `/researcher` skill | ARIA v2 — spawn explorers, synthesize, critic |

### Subagents (spawned by main session, return and die)
| Role | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Coder | Subagent | Make failing tests pass. Never sees spec. |
| Test-Manager | Subagent | Own RED gate — write tests, verify they fail |
| Tester | Subagent | Helper for test-manager (additional tests) |
| Reviewer-Lite | Subagent | Fast review for complexity 4-7 |
| Reviewer | Subagent | Full adversarial review for complexity 8+ |
| BA | Subagent | Requirements gathering (complexity 6+) |
| Architect | Subagent | System design + ADRs (complexity 8+) |
| Explorer | Subagent | Focused research angle (haiku, parallel) |
| Research-Critic | Subagent | Adversarial review of research synthesis |
| UI-Designer | Subagent | Visual design loop (opus) |
| Data-Analyst | Subagent | Iterative data analysis (sonnet) |

## Coder Workflow (TRIO)
1. Read this file (AGENTS.md)
2. Read your briefing (task + test file paths)
3. Read the failing tests — understand expected behavior
4. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
5. Run: `npm test` — verify GREEN
6. Run: `npm run typecheck` — verify no type errors
7. Write result to the path specified in your briefing

DO NOT SKIP steps 5-6. If tests fail, fix before proceeding.
DO NOT read specs/ directory — you work from tests only.

> **Workflow variant**: In workflow-enabled projects, the implementation cycle can be
> driven by the `wave-dispatch` workflow for automated parallel coder dispatch.
> Trigger with `ultracode: implement <feature>` or use `/sdd` which delegates automatically.

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict, no `any` — use `unknown` + guards
- Full words in names: `processPayment()` not `procPay()`
- Return types on all public functions
- Tests verify behavior, not existence

## Boundaries
### ✅ Always safe
- Read any file for understanding
- Run tests, typecheck, lint
- Modify files in src/ and tests/

### 🚫 Never
- Read specs/ (information barrier — you work from tests)
- Modify STATUS.md, NEXT-SESSION.md
- Use `pool: 'forks'` in vitest (causes OOM)
- Run raw `tsc --noEmit` (use `npm run typecheck`)
- Force push, reset --hard, rm -rf

## Testing
- Runner: vitest (threads pool, NEVER forks)
- Pattern: `tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`
- One change → verify → next change. Never stack unverified.

## Project Structure
- `src/` — source code (your primary output)
- `tests/` — test files (your primary input)
- `specs/` — DO NOT READ
- `.claude/` — agent infrastructure (agents, rules, skills, hooks)
- `.pipeline/` — pipeline state (read-only)
